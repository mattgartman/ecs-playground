# ECS Playground
Started from https://github.com/awslabs/ecs-refarch-cloudformation but repuprosing and playing around enough it doesn't make sense to keep forked.


Plans are to create a production ready ECS cluster, hosting Jenkins, and build out of several workloads with automated deployment.
